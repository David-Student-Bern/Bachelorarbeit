# Bachelorarbeit

This repository contains all the code used for my Bachelor Thesis. It includes Code from other sources, namely:

- Notebook `kepler_lightcurve.ipynb` (Downloading and Using Kepler Data to Plot a Light Curve) by Thomas Dutkiewicz: [Github page](https://github.com/spacetelescope/notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/MAST/Kepler/Kepler_Lightcurve/kepler_lightcurve.ipynb)
  
- FLATW'RM (FLAre deTection With Ransac Method) is a code that uses machine learning method to detect flares by Vida and Roettenbacher: [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...616A.163V/abstract) and [Github page](https://github.com/vidakris/flatwrm/blob/master/README.md).

- AFD (Python script for Automated Flare Detection and flare analysis) by Althukair and Tsiklauri: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10224) and [Github page](https://github.com/akthukair/AFD)


For the purpose of my thesis, the two flare-finding algorithms had to be modified, which is explained in detail in my thesis. For any questions on how to use the Code, a short description of the process is added below.
